        <P>Maruti Suzuki India Limited, formerly known as Maruti Udyog Limited, is an Indian automobile manufacturer,
            based in New Delhi. It was founded in 1981 and owned by the Government of India until 2003, when it was sold
            to the Japanese automaker Suzuki Motor Corporation.[2][7] As of September 2022 Maruti Suzuki has a market
            share of 42 percent in the Indian passenger car marke</P>

        <h3 id="ab">ABOUT US</h3>
        <P>n 1982, a license and joint venture agreement (JVA) was signed between Maruti Udyog Ltd., and Suzuki of
            Japan. At first, Maruti Suzuki was mainly an importer of cars. In India's closed market, Maruti received the
            right to import 2 fully built-up Suzuki in the first two years, and even after that, the early goal was to
            use only 33% indigenous parts. This upset the local manufacturers considerably. There were some concerns
            that the Indian market was too small to absorb the comparatively large production planned by Maruti Suzuki,
            with the government even considering adjusting the petrol tax and lowering the excise duty in order to boost
            sales.[11] Local production commenced in December 1983 with the introduction of the SS30/SS40 Suzuki
            Fronte/Alto-based Maruti 800.[12] In 1984, the Maruti Van with the same three-cylinder engine as the 800 was
            released and the installed capacity of the plant in Gurgaon reached 40,000 units.</P>
        <p>In 1985, the Suzuki SJ410-based Gypsy a 970 cc 4WD off-road vehicle, was launched. In 1986, the original 800
            was replaced by an all-new model of the 796 cc hatchback Suzuki Alto (SS80), and the 100,000th vehicle was
            produced by the company.[13] In 1987, the company started exporting to western markets, when a lot of 500
            cars were sent to Hungary. By 1988, the capacity of the Gurgaon plant was increased to 100,000 units per
            annum.</p>
        <p>
        <p><b>Market liberalisation </b></p>
        In 1989, the Maruti 1000 was introduced and the 970 cc, three-box was India's first contemporary sedan. By
        1991, 65 percent of the components, for all vehicles produced, were indigenized. After the liberalization of
        the Indian economy in 1991, Suzuki increased its stake in Maruti to 50 percent, making the company a 50-50
        joint venture with the government of India as the other stakeholder.</p>

        <P>Maruti Suzuki has 2,413 Arena sales outlets across 1,992 cities and 380 Nexa sales outlets across 228 cities
            in India.[5] The company aims to increase its sales network to 4,000 outlets by 2020.[72] It has 4044
            service stations across 1,861 cities throughout India.[73] Maruti's dealership network is larger than that
            of enough known companies combined.[74] Service is a major revenue generator of the company. Most of the
            service stations are managed on franchise basis, where Maruti Suzuki trains the local staff. Also, The
            Express Service stations exist, sending across their repairman to the vehicle if it is away from a normal
            service center.[75][76]
